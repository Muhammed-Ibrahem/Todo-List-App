**Frontend-mentor challenge to make a responsive Todo-List with `DARK/LIGHT` themes**

**In this challenge I practiced my ReactJs, css-modules and made a **State-Manager** simulating the way **REDUX** works by making a store and actions and to perform any state change you gotta dispatch an action, and for the theme I created a context to control the theme state whether it is dark or light then I changed a class to the body and according to that class the colors of all elements change**

## Tools ðŸ”¨

- HTML5
